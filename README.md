##Mobilog
Mobilog is an Android wardriving application that allows to log GPS coordinates, Cellular Network details (e.g. cell-IDs, RSSIs, Neighboring Cells, Connection States, etc.), and Wifi Access Points information (e.g. SSID, BSSID, RSSI, Frequency, Encryption).

Tracks are saved into the SD-CARD (or built-in internal storage) of your android-based smartphone. You can decide whether to just use plain CSV format, or to additionally include for each path a KML file for visual analysis on Google Earth and Google Maps.
